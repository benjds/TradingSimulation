# Trading Simulation

The aim of this project is to develop a VBA application to rebuild our trade file from the order files of all your fellow broker-dealers. In addition, we will summarize the market activity by drawing some fancy graphs (more on this below).

Furthermore, we develop a VBA application to import all these files, simulate the working of the order book, and recover your trade file. In addition, we will produce a time series of the inside quotes (best bid price and quantity, best ask price and quantities), and draw the time series of the best prices (indicating on this same graph the trades at the quotes would be a plus).
